How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows the lines where the difference is present in the file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    because it is possible some codes in my older versions are more efficient
    than newer so if I have access to it I can easily make use of it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    Pros:
    By manually choosing we know that when we make a conceptual change we have
    make a commit and program is compiled also.
    Cons:
    since it is manual, we can forget to make commit some time when needed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Since during coding we want multiple files to read at a time like .html .css
    and .js while in google docs usually we doesn't want files to open at the
    same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the complete history of the commits of the files that were
    saved and a line for each commit to show the change
    git diff gives the difference between two different commits and shows
    the lines which were added and which were removed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    since using git checkout I can easily find in which commit I have introduced
    the bug and then using git diff I can easily find what is the bug .

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I think for my web page code so that every time I change it I get access to
    each previous commits.
