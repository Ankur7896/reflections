What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    A hidden directory named .git is created inside the given directory
    which contain all the commits of that directory.
    We need it to save commits inside it.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    Staging is a step before the commit process in git. That is, a commit in git
    is performed in two steps: staging and actual commit. As long as a changeset
    is in the staging area, git allows you to edit it as you like (replace staged
    files with other versions of staged files, remove changes from staging, etc.).


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    after applying the change I add the commit to staging area and then I compare
    it with the file in the reposiary using git diff --.... command if the change
    is logical I will save it to the repositary otherwise I donot.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
    when I want to keep my master commit intact and make some experimental changes
    to my code  or suppose to convert my website to another language I use branch since
    they keep the original master files intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    with the help of diagram we can trace out complete graph of our commits
    including branches.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
    When two branches are mergerd together, there ends are combined to form a
    single commit.
    Since it is the best way to get feel of merging.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
    Pros:
    Sometimes there is a conflict that git can't solve itself so manual merging
    is necessary in that case.
    Cons:
    When not necessary manual merging takes extra time and why to do it manually
    when we can do it automaticaly.
